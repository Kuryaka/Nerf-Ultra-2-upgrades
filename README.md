# Nerf-Ultra-2-upgrades

Please see https://github.com/LCobeaga/Nerf-Ultra-2-upgrades for the original author! He designed the cylinder and put in the bulk of the effort in tweaking this to work.

This is an Elite retrofit kit for the Nerf Ultra 2. 

Other than the circuitry components of the flywheel cage (i.e. motors, wheels, wires) you will not need extra hardware. 

Check Fusion 360 parameters for custom flywheel spacings.  

## Assembly and Blaster Modifications

#### This kit is not just a drop in! You will need to make some permanent modifications to the blaster. The changes do not prevent you from swapping back to the stock cylinder and pusher. 

To make the blaster feed consistently, you'll need to cut away some material near the pusher. 
Below are some photos of how your blaster should look after you make the cuts.

You will also need to make sure your trigger has the longest possible draw, so make sure it is aligned as below.
