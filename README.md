# Nerf-Ultra-2-upgrades
Modifications for the Nerf Ultra 2 to improve performance

Current plans for the Ultra 2 are :
- new cylinder that can hold regular darts that is not just a barrel insert 
- increase capacity of cylinder to 8+ darts
- new flywheel cage to compensate for the change in dart center position (due to smaller dart diameter and same sized cylinder)
- new flywheels in the vain of Kuryaka's daybreaks, but keep cage compatible with original wheels

Future plans for the blaster are:
- brushless motor support, as the flywheel cage is similar in dimention to the cage used on Shadow Price
- larger grip for more comfortable use
  - also in favor of just grip inserts that fill in the front of the grip and cover the spike at the bottom
- rev trigger with a greater slant or curved surface, akin to Bobololo's rev trigger
- cosmetic variants to the barrel that would replace the entire component pair

As a final note, I'm working on my own micro-brushless flywheel hand-cannons so most likely I wont get to everything on this list. 
I do , however, want to "port" (measure and try to copy the blaster into CAD) as much of the blaster as I can so that anyone who is passionate of the blaster can get right into personalizing and modding it, instead of spending days measuring and testing first.
