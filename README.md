# Nerf-Ultra-2-upgrades
Modifications for the Nerf Ultra 2 to improve performance

This is essentially a drop in replacement for the ultra 2 to fire regular size elite darts. 
Currently there is a single 9 dart replacement cylinder, and flywheel cages meant for 130-180 sized motors. 

Other than the actual components of the flywheel cage (i.e. motors, wheels, etc) only a stronger sprint or a doubled up one is needed for the kit and it is optional. 
The spring helps with retaining cylinder position WHILE NOT FIRING thus it is prefrence whether your cylinder holds well enough for you. 

I have taken the time to add a parametric feature to the fusion 360 file, so if you want a flywheel spacing that I didnt supply as an stl it should be as simple as putting in the new preffered dimention in a single, highlited and named spot in the parametric menu. 

Future plans for the blaster are:
- brushless motor support, as the flywheel cage is similar in dimention to the cage used on Shadow Price
- larger grip for more comfortable use
  - also in favor of just grip inserts that fill in the front of the grip and cover the spike at the bottom
- rev trigger with a greater slant or curved surface, akin to Bobololo's rev trigger
- cosmetic variants to the barrel that would replace the entire component pair

As a final note, I'm working on my own micro-brushless flywheel hand-cannons so most likely I wont get to everything on this list. 
I do , however, want to "port" (measure and try to copy the blaster into CAD) as much of the blaster as I can so that anyone who is passionate of the blaster can get right into personalizing and modding it, instead of spending days measuring and testing first.
