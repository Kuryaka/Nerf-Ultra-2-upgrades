Please see https://github.com/LCobeaga/Nerf-Ultra-2-upgrades for the original author! He designed the cylinder and put in the bulk of the effort in tweaking this to work.

## Assembly and Blaster Modifications

#### This kit is not just a drop in! You will need to make some permanent modifications to the blaster. The changes do not prevent you from swapping back to the stock cylinder and pusher. 

To make the blaster feed consistently, you'll need to cut away some material near the pusher. 
Below are some photos of how your blaster should look after you make the cuts.

You will also need to make sure your trigger has the longest possible draw, so make sure it is aligned as below.

The Ultra 2 has a convenient screw port for the "standard" Omron V15 switches. You'll need to do a bit of shell work to clear it out, but this, plus the Ultra2Rev part, gives you a much clickier feel and more robust circuitry.
