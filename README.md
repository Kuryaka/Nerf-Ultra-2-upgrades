Please see https://github.com/LCobeaga/Nerf-Ultra-2-upgrades for the original author! He designed the cylinder and put in the bulk of the effort in tweaking this to work.

## Assembly and Blaster Modifications

#### This kit is not just a drop in! You will need to make some permanent modifications to the blaster. The changes do not prevent you from swapping back to the stock cylinder and pusher. 

There is a piece of ribbing underneath the cage and assorted other shell nubs that get in the way. You'll happen upon them as you're fitting the shell together. Yeet them with a pair of diagonal cutters or pliers. 

To make the blaster feed consistently, you'll need to cut away some material near the pusher. 
Below are some photos of how your blaster should look after you make the cuts.

The Ultra 2 has a convenient screw port for the "standard" Omron V15 switches. You'll need to do a bit of shell work to clear it out, but this, plus the Ultra2Rev part, gives you a much clickier feel and more robust circuitry.
